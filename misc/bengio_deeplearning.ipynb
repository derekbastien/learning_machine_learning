    "- representation learning: using machine learning to representations in the data <br>\n",
    "    - can result in better performance than hand-designed representations\n",
    "    - allow AI to rapidly adapt to new tasks\n",
    "    - can discover new set of features in time proportional to complexity of problem, but much quicker than humans\n",
    "    - example is Autoencoder\n",
    "- goal of factor design: separate the factors of fariation that explain the observed data <br>\n",
    "    - for example a car image, factors of variation would include, position, its color, angle and brightness of the sun\n",
    "    - issue is that many factors of variation influence every piece of data we are able to observe\n",
    "        - at night red may appear black, a silhouette depends on angle of viewing\n",
    "        - most applications require us to disentabgle factors of variation and discard what we dont care about\n",
    "- Deep Learning solves problem in representation learning by introducing representations that are expressed in terms of other, simpler representations\n",
    "    - allows the computer to build complex concepts out of simpler ones      \n",
